# Simple-Android-MVP-Implementation
This is a simple implementation of MVP pattern in an android project. But this project should not be considered as a complete guide of MVP 
pattern rather a simplefied implementation to get the idea of how MVP pattern may be adopted in an android project.

In a complete project RxJava, Dagger 2 and Butterknife libray may be implemented to give the project a concrete look.
